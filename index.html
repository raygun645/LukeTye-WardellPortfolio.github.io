								<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\IM.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am Luke (Tye) Tye-Wardell, a driven and committed game developer and programmer currently specializing in AI and gameplay systems. As a graduate and current master's student at Staffordshire University,  I hold a bachelor's degree in games development and am currently pursuing a master's degree in games programming. C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity are just a few of the programming languages and development environments I have refined my abilities and gained considerable experience with during my time as a student.</p>
								<p>I aspire to one day become an AI engineer in game development, designing intricate and intelligent systems that adapt to players and create truly amazing gameplay experiences for everyone. I love trying to solve complex programming challenges and work to continuously refine my skills as a games programmer</p>
								<p>I encourage you to browse through my portfolio, which includes a selection of <a href="#work">my work</a> that demonstrates my technical skills, inventiveness, and passion for the game industry. I'm thrilled to connect with you and share my passion for game creation, whether you're here to view my projects, read more about my background, or talk about possible prospects.</p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed developing it.</p>

								<p><i>This section showcases some of the projects i have created for University</i></p>
								<h3 class="major">Masters Project 1 - Procedural Levels</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<div class="video-wrapper">
									<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9n7jdqANVo8?si=2v-ra8D9znPAIvz0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								</div>
								<p>My first masters project was based around expanding research i had done into the area of Procedural content generation during my undergraduate disertation, for this i reseached 
									different techniques that could be used for the puropse of level generation for a dungeon crawler game and developed them into working level generators as seen in the above video, 
									this and my other two masters projects formed the basis for my final project, to create a dungeon crawler that uses Procedural generation and AI for gameplay elements.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<h3 class="major">Masters Project 2 - Procedural Assets and placement</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g27GC94ulc?si=jfsof0IAv9uGL7nF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>My second masters project shifted focus away from procedural levels and towards procedural assets and their placement within a level, for this techniques for procedural asset 
									placement were reseached and tested to ensure they would work within the previous level generator. Research was also conducted into how procedural assets are created and systems 
									were developed to create procedural weapons, items and enemies.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<h3 class="major">Masters Project 3 - Artifical inteligence</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8WkcX89fIg?si=CFdVHsQO03oEbh-d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>The goal of my third masters project was to reseach and develop AI for the procedural enemies. Finite state machines, fuzzy state machines and behavior trees were each 
									reseached and an acompanining system was developed, each system was then tested to see which solution worked the best based on project paramiters 
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<h3 class="major">Masters Project 4 - Encapsulation of previous work</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4kNh-ZjrA5s?si=579q1WtttjoG2Rvt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>For my final masters project, a prototype dungeon crawler was developed using each of the previous systems, reseach was conducted into gameplay elements found within
									a dungeon crawler and mechanics were developed. Once in a testable state, volunteers were invited to test the game to see if each previous system worked well together
									as well as seeing if the game was fun.

								<h2 class="major">Personal</h2>
								<p><i>This section showcases some of the projects i have created as personal projects</i></p>
								
								<!--<h3 class="major">Project Rowe</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b67qgDf9xRM?si=vVn4OCEOHpSUY212" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>Another one of the personal projects i'm working on currently is a game inspired by the infamous series, the main objective for this was to create a power system similar
									to that of infamous that could also be used within other projects in C++, currently the power system allows the player to collect three different powers and use their specific
									projectiles, this section will also be updated with the most recent developments.  
								</p> -->

								<h3 class="major">Farmer project</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?si=wnyJYpSDKhkG9vbk&amp;list=PLreFe8CmuOfoGCxE5X8k3aVSLEkf2kFGK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>One of the personal projects i'm working on currently is a game called Farmer, this is a simple game about planting crops and 
									making money from them, each gameplay element present was prototyped using Visual scripting and then rebuilt in C++.  
								</p>
								<p>Above is a playlist of the current progress of the project, it is updated with new videos when features are developed and added.
								</p>

								<h3 class="major">Machine learning for cars</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W30BBYKmy6U?si=g1y2xnP-fFsnltkE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>Another personal project i created was machine learning cars, the main objective for this was to simply train an agent to go around
									a track within Unreal engine 5, i wanted to understand more about machine learning and how it can be used wihtin games.  
								</p>

								<h3 class="major">AI Game jam - Cooking With Words</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubZRr-f7dwU?si=D9Lw_-J_1S5hjh-k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>During the AI and Games summer school a game jam was held. Myself and one other developer created a game called Cooking With words, the gameplay loop consists of 
									the player running between stations and typing ingredients. Once the player has enough ingredients, they run back to the cooking machine which creates a cake.
								</p>
								<p>In the background, each ingredient is given to a locally ran LLM which generates a name and a description for a cake, this is then passed to a locally ran 
									stable diffusion model which generates and image for the cake using the generated name and description. This was created in 28 hours.
								</p>

								<h3 class="major">Mobile Project - Endless Runner</h3>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWSMJNz1y4k?si=ABGtc2CZXXdkCpPV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>This was a smaller project i created to familiarise myself with unreal engine while trying to learn, it is an endless runner that showcases several different 
									gameplay mechanics such as procedural obstacles, a save system for high scores and coins as well as a magnet upgrade for collecting coins easier.
